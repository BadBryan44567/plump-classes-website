## EQUILIBRIUM
According to Newton's second law, acceleration is proportinal to force.Expressing mathematically, $F\propto a$ or $F=ma$ Where F is the force acting on the object, 'm' is the mass of the object and 'a' is the acceleration.

 In general, many forces act on an object at any instant of time. For example, if a book is lying on a table at rest, the forces acting on the book are gravity and normal force. since both the forces are balanced, the book is at rest. ie., the book is in static equilibrium. Here *the gravity and normal forces are not the action -reaction forces. They are two different forces acting on an object simultaneously.*

 Thus, the firssst condition for equilibrium is net force must be equal to zero.

 Let us try to understand the concept with a numerical example.

 A photo frame of 1.5kg is handing to a wall by two cables which are making an angle of $30^0$ with the horizontal. what is the tension force in each cable.

 We have to write the x-component forces and y-component forces.
 x-component forces are balanced as-one is acting towards positive direction and the other in negative direction.
 y-component forces are balanced by the weight.
 $$F_y=F_t sinsin\theta=F_g$$
 $$F_g=1.5kg\times 9.8\frac{N}{kg}=14.7N$$
 $$ F_t sinsin30^0=14.7N$$
 $$F_t=29.4N$$
 Tension in each cable is 29.4N

 Let us see the second condition for the equilibrium: 
  *net torque must be equal to zero.*
 In rotational motion, angular acceleration is proportinal to Torque. Expressing it mathematically,
 $$Torque \tau=I\alpha$$ 
 I = moment of inertia or rotational inertia of an object
 $$\alpha=angular acceleration$$
 Let us try to understand this with a numerial example.
 It is our common experience that children play see-saw. One such see-saw board has a mass of 5.0 kg and a child having mass 36kg sits 2.0 m from pivot. At what distance the 2nd child of mass 30kg should place herself to balance the see-saw?

 Let us write the conditions for equilibrium
 $$\sum F=0$$
 $$\tau = 0$$
 $$F_p=W_1+W_2+M g$$
 $$\sum\tau=0$$
 $$W_1\times{r_1} = W_2\times{r_2}$$
 We are calculating the torque through the pivot point P, the lever arm for$F_N$ & the board P is zero.
 $$36\times9.8\times2.0=30\times9.8\times{r_2}$$
 $$r_2=2.4m$$

 A uniform beam 1.0m long with mass 2.0 kg is mounted by a small hinge on a wall as shown in fig. The beam is held in a horizontal position by a cable that makes an angle of 30^0. The beam supports a sign of mass 15kg suspended from its end. Determine the force exerted by the hinge and the tension in the supporting cable.

 let us the hinge as the axis of rotation
length of the beam=1.0m
mass of the beam m =2.0kg
$$\sum\tau = 0$$
$$F_Ty\times{1.0}=M\times{g}\times{1.0}+m\times{g}\times{0.5m}$$      
$$F_Ty\times{1.0}=15.0\times{9.8}\times1.0+2.0kg\times9.8\times0.5m$$
$$F_Ty = 156.80N$$
Sum of the forces in the horizontal direction is equal to zero.
$$\sum F_x = 0$$	
$$F_{Hx} = F_{Tx}$$  
From the geometry of the figure, $$tantan\theta=\frac{F_Ty}{F_Tx}$$
