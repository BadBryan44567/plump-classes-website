## Work 

In Physics work is said to be done if force displaces an object.

Thus work $w = \vec{F} \times \vec{d}$
$$ w = |\vec{f}||\vec{d}|\cos\cos\theta$$

Where $\vec{F}$  = Force $\vec{d}$ = displacement $\theta$ = angle between force and displacement

Thus, work not only depends on the applied force and displacement, it also depends on the angle between them.

Here force and displacement are vectors where as work is a scalar.

**Energy is the capacity to do the work.**

Let us see how work and energy are related.

Whenever work is done on an object, it gets stored in the form of energy in the object. If work is done by the object, then the stored energy gets expended.

Both work and energy are measured in **joules** in SI.

Hence there is a continuous transformation of energy between the system and surroundings.
Here system in the sense the objects under consideration, and surroundings are everything else.

Let us try to understand the types of mechanical energy and their relation to work.

## Mechanical Energy

Mechanical energy is broadly of two types.

Potential energy and kinetic energy.

**Potential energy** is the energy possessed by the body by virtue of its state,

There are 2 types of potential energy:-

**Gravitational potential energy** and **Elasitic Potential Energy**

### Kinetic Energy
Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by a body by virtue of its motion.

We know, work $w = \vec{F} \times \vec{d}$
But F = ma

And from Kinematic equation ${v_f}^2 = {v_i}^2 + 2ad$, 
$$ d = \frac{{v_f}^2 - {v_i}^2}{2a} $$

Substituting f and d in the work equation,

$$ w = ma(\frac{{v_f}^2 - {v_i}^2}{2a}) $$
$$ w = \frac{1}{2}m({v_f}^2 - {v_i}^2) $$
$$ w = \frac{1}{2}m(\Delta v^2) $$

$\frac{1}{2} mv^2$ is called the kinetic energy and the above relation is called **work -energy theorem.**

Thus, kinetic energy depends on both mass and velocity of the object.

### Potential Energy
#### Gravitaional Potential Energy
Let us consider the gravitational potential energy, here the work done against the gravity on an object is stored in the form of gravitational potential energy. The force acting on an object is its weight(mg), and the displacement is the distance moved by the object from the reference point.

$w = \vec{f} \times \vec{d}$
$w = mgh$

Where m=mass of the object
g = acceleration due to gravity
h=distance moved from the reference point.

As the work is done on the object against the gravity and that work is stored in the form of gravitational potential energy.

If the object falls from a height h to ground, work is done by the object and the energy gets expended.
#### Elastic Potential Energy

Next elastic potential energy. This is the energy associated with the elastic materials.

According to **Hooke’s law** $F=-kx$

Where F is the restoring force and k is the force constant and x is the displacement.

Let us try to understand the meaning of **restoring force**. Whenever we apply a force on an object, it changes the shape of the object. In case of elastic materials, the object tries to restore its original shape. The force which acts opposite to the applied force, to bring the object back to its original shape is called the **restoring force**.

Initially there is no force acting on the object and then because of the applied force, restoring force comes into picture. Hence, we have to take the average force.

Average Force $$F = \frac{0 + kx}{2}$$
$$F_{avg} = \frac{1}{2}kx$$
Work done $w = \vec{F} \times \vec{d}$
$$w = \frac{1}{2}kx(x)$$

Therefore, Elastic Potential Energy = 

$$\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
Before proceeding further, let us see different types of forces.  There are two types of forces. Conservative forces and non-conservative forces. 

**Conservative forces** do not depend on the actual path followed by the body. In a closed system total work-done by the conservative forces is zero. Example gravity. 

*Work done by the conservative forces* gets stored in the object will conserve where as the work done by the non-conservative forces will not conserve. Non conservative forces depend on the actual path followed by the object. Example friction.

## Angle on the Work Done

Let us see the role of angle on the work done by the object.

As we know work $$ w = \vec{F} \times \vec{d} = |\vec{f}||\vec{d}|\cos\cos\theta$$

If angle between the force and displacement is zero, then $\cos \cos 0 = 1$, work done on the object is maximum and the maximum energy transfer takes place between the system and surroundings.

If the angle is between 0 and 90 i.e., $0< \theta < 90$, the work-done on the object is not maximum and the energy transfer between the system and surroundings decreases, less than maximum.

If the angle between the force and displacement is 90° the work done on the object is zero since $\cos \cos 90°= 0$   and no net energy transfer takes place.
{{<boxmd>}}
Question: - What is the work done by normal force? Explain
{{</boxmd>}}

If the angle between the force and displacement is 180° then the work is done by the object expending its internal energy and the work done is termed as negative. ($\cos \cos 180° = -1$ ) as the energy is transferred from the system to surroundings.
{{<boxmd>}}
**Caution: - while calculating the angle between the force and displacement, you should be careful not to consider the ramp angle if the object is on the ramp. In the below picture, the object is on the ramp with an angle $\theta$, but the angle between the force and displacement is zero.**

## Conservation of Energy
 
Conservation of energy: - Energy of an isolated system remains constant.

Let us try to understand the principle of conservation of energy with an example.
In simple pendulum, when the bob is at the extreme position, it has only gravitational potential energy. At the equilibrium position, it has only kinetic energy. At any intermediate position, it has both kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy.

At the extreme position $E = Ug = mgh$ as velocity of the bob=0

At the equilibrium position $E = K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$

At any intermediate position, it has both kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy.

Let us calculate the total energy at the intermediate position. 

At the intermediate position $E = Ug + k$

We know $${v_f}^2 - {v_i}^2 + 2ad$$
$$ v_i = 0; d = h; a = g$$
$$ \therefore {v_f}^2 = 2gh $$
$$k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}m(2gh) = mgh $$
$$ k = \frac{k}{2} = \frac{1}{2}mgh$$
$$U_g = mg(\frac{h}{2})$$
Energy $$ E = U_g + k  = \frac{mgh}{2} + \frac{mgh}{2} = mgh$$

Conservation of energy can be represented by bar charts also known as lol diagrams.
Let us see one example of the bar chart representing the conservation of energy.

Next spring is out of the system.
Energy transfer takes place between the system and surroundings by means of doing the work.
The diagram looks like this.

**While drawing these charts one should be careful about the number of blocks. Left side blocks should be equal to right side blocks. Initial energy is 5 units so final energy must also be equal to 5 ( 3.5 + 1.5 )**

## Power
Power is rate of doing work or rate of transfer of energy

Power $$P = \frac{Work}{time} = \frac{joule}{second} = watt $$

Since work = change in Energy

Power $$P = \frac{Energy Trasferred}{time} = \frac{E}{t}$$
$$P = \frac{w}{t} = \frac{\vec{f} \times \vec{d}}{t} = \vec{F} \times \vec{v}$$
Watt is a small unit, power is generally measured in kilowatt-hours or horsepower

**1 kWH = 1000 W x 3600s = 3.6106 J**

**1 HP = 746 W**
