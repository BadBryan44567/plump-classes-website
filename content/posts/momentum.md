## What is Momentum ?
Momentum is the product of mass and velocity of an object. 
$$\vec{p} = m\vec{v} $$

Where $\vec{p}$ is the momentum, $m$ is the mass and $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the object.

Newton's Second law states that $\vec{F} \propto \vec{a}$ **or** $\vec{F} = m\vec{a} \to (1)$

where $\vec{F}$ = the net force acting on the object.

$\vec{a}$ = acceleration produced in the object

$m$ = mass of the object 

we know that acceleration $$\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{v_f} - \vec{v_i}}{t}$$

where $\vec{v_f}$ = Final Velocity of the object 

$\vec{v_i}$ = Initial Velocity of the Object

$t$ = Time Interval

Now rewriting the equation (1)

$$\vec{F} = m(\frac{\vec{v_f} - \vec{v_i}}{t})$$

$$\vec{F} = \frac{m\vec{v_f}}{t} - \frac{m\vec{v_i}}{t} $$

$$\vec{F}(t) = m\vec{v_f} - m\vec{v_i}$$

$$\vec{F}(t) = \vec{P_f} - \vec{P_i}$$

$$\vec{F}(t) = \Delta p$$

$$J = \Delta p$$

$$J = Impulse measured in newton - second in SI$$


## Significance of Impulse in Everyday Life

Here impulsive force is the large force acting for a short interval of time.
Its our common experience that the fragile articles are wrapped in bubble paper and air bags are kept in between the boxes. The reason is when we transport the delicate items through containers, the driver at times may use sudden breaks and due to sudden break, the boxes hit each other and a large amount of force acts for a short interval of time thus damaging the goods.

Similarly, in automobiles drivers and passengers are supposed to wear seat belts and are provided by the air bags. The reason is in whiplash, the driver and passengers experience a large force for a short interval of time and they hit the interiors of the vehicle. If they are not protected by the air bags, their internal organs get damaged and leads to loss of life.

The above example can be seen by a numerical example

**Q**: Let us calculate the amount of force exerted on an automobile of mass 25,000 kg travelling with a speed of 24m/s, applies the breaks gently in 20s, slams in 2s, and hits the concrete wall in 0.2s.

**Solution:**

Here,

$$m = 25000 kg$$
$$\vec{v_i} = 24 ms^-1$$
$$\vec{v_f} = 0 ms^-1$$
$$t = 20s$$
$$\vec{F} = \frac{25000 \times (24-0)}{20} = 30,000 N$$
$$\vec{F} = \frac{25000 \times (24-0)}{2} = 300,000 N$$
$$\vec{F} = \frac{25000 \times (24-0)}{0.2} = 3,000,000 N$$


Above example clearly shows the relation between the time and Impulsive force.
