**Newton’s law of universal gravitation:** - Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This force acts along the line joining the two particles.
$$ F_G = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} $$
m₁ , m₂ = masses of the particles
r = distance between the particles
G = Universal Gravitaional Constant Found Experimentally = $ 6.67 \times 10^{-11}\frac{Nm^2}{kg^2}$

These Forces are action-reaction forces

## Numericals
Three masses are aligned as shown below.

a) Calculate the net force on m₂
b) Calculate the magnitude and the direction of the initial acceleration as m₂ begins to move.

Force between m₁ and m₂ os given by
$$ F_1  = F_G = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{(r_1)^2} $$

Force between m₂ and m₃ is given by   
$$ F_2 = F_G = \frac{Gm_2m_3}{(r_2)^2} $$
$$ F_{Net} = - F_1 + F_2 $$
F₁ acts towards left and F₂ acts towards right.
$$ F_{Net} = Gm_2[-\frac{m_1}{(r_1)^2} + \frac{m_3}{(r_2)^2}] $$
Inserting the Values, we get $ F_{Net}$ on $m_2 = -1.80 \times 10^{-6} N $
Rounding the value $F_{Net}$ on $ m_2 = -2.0 \times 10^{-7} N$
$$F_{Net} = m_2a $$
$$ -2.0 \times 10^{-7} N = 2.0 \times 10^4 a $$
$$ a = -1.0 \times 10^{-11} ms^{-2} $$
Negative indicates that the acceleration is towards the left.

Let us see one more example to understand the concept.

Three identical very dense masses of 4700kg are placed on the x-axis. One mass is at -110cm and another one is at the origin and the third one is at 380cm from origin. What is the net gravitational force on the mass at the origin due to the other two masses?

Here mass m₂ pulls mass m₁ towards the right and mass m₂ pulls mass m₃ towards the  left. Since all masses are the same.

Thus,
