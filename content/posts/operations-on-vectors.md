## Components of Vectors

So far we added vectors by using a scale diagram and properties of right triangles. But calculations with tight triangles work only when the two vectros are perpendicular.

So we need a simple but general method for adding vectors. This is called the method of components.

To define what we mean by the componenets of a vector A, we begin with a rectangular (cartesian) coordinate system of axes. If we thing of $\vec{A}$ as a displacement vector, we can regard  $\vec{A}$ as the sum of the sum of a displacemment parallel to the x-axis and a displacement parallel to the y -axis. We use the numbers Ax and Ay to tell us how much displacement there is parallel to the x-axis and how much there is parallel to the y-axis, repectively.

For example, if the +x-axis points east and the +y-axis points north.  $\vec{A}$ in Fig 1.17 could be the sum of a 2.00 m displacemtn to the east and a 1.00 m displacemtn to the north. the Ax = +2.00m and Ay +1.00m. We can use the same idea for any vectors, not just displacement vectors. The two numbers Ax and Ay are called the **components** of  $\vec{A}$.

**CAUTION: Components are not vectors** The components Ax abd Ay of a vectro  $\vec{A}$ are numbers: they are _not_ vectoes themselves.

In Fig 1.17a= Ax and Ay are positive, This is consistent with Eqs.(1.5); $\theta$ us ub tge first quadrant ( between 0 and 90 degrees), and both the cosine and sine of an aghnle in this quadrant are positive. But in Fig 1.18a the compnent Bx is negative and the componebnt By is positive. (If the +x-axis points east and +y-axis points north,  $\vec{B}$ could represent a displacemtn of 2.00m west and 1.00m north. Since west is in the -x direction and north is in the +y direction, Bx = -2.00m is negative and By = +1.00m is positive.)

Again this is consitent with Eqs (1.5); now $\theta$ is in the seconf quadrant, so cos $\theta$ is negative and sin $\theta$ is positibe. In Fig 1.18b both Cx and Cy are negative ( both cos $\theta$ and sin $\theta$ are negative in the third quadrant.)

**Relating a vector's magnitude and direction to its components** equations (1.5) are correct  _only_ when the angle $\theta$ is measured from the positive x-axis. If the angle of the vector is given from a diffrent reference direction or you use a different refrence direction , the relationships are diffrent! Example 1.6 illustrates this point.
