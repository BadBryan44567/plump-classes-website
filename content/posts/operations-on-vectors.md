## Components of Vectors

So far we added vectors by using a scale diagram and properties of right triangles. But calculations with tight triangles work only when the two vectros are perpendicular.

So we need a simple but general method for adding vectors. This is called the method of components.

To define what we mean by the componenets of a vector A, we begin with a rectangular (cartesian) coordinate system of axes. If we thing of $\vec{A}$ as a displacement vector, we can regard  $\vec{A}$ as the sum of the sum of a displacemment parallel to the x-axis and a displacement parallel to the y -axis. We use the numbers Ax and Ay to tell us how much displacement there is parallel to the x-axis and how much there is parallel to the y-axis, repectively.

For example, if the +x-axis points east and the +y-axis points north.  $\vec{A}$ in Fig 1.17 could be the sum of a 2.00 m displacemtn to the east and a 1.00 m displacemtn to the north. the Ax = +2.00m and Ay +1.00m. We can use the same idea for any vectors, not just displacement vectors. The two numbers Ax and Ay are called the **components** of  $\vec{A}$.

**CAUTION: Components are not vectors** The components Ax abd Ay of a vectro  $\vec{A}$ are numbers: they are _not_ vectoes themselves.
