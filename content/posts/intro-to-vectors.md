## Introduction

Vector in Physics is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.

For example, when you walk to a mall, a ile east of your residence and come back, your displacement is zero and the distance travelled is 2 km.

![mall](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/B9xNUO211KDn9j-_rNU3p3jhedSSdk_a8XUKw-Gp9YitxY2FAVHJoCBrr0lW4jwbdl5ryZhG2f1gYVsEeck_1XRNKDuNuqDd3FR4xEGuqEnb1BdiJAoLwKksd88O56hZwoIWR94CJvI4Ndv7yfVXzqmptP0Ne574eFvvuECSikLYwbboz1_MNl6qDzZQZ2YWA8CeMYbwHg)

Here Displacement is a vector quantity where East is taken as positive, so when you reach the mall, your distance is +2 km.

When you come back home, the total displacemnt = + 2 km - 2 km = 0.
Whereas distance travelled = 2 km + 1mile = 2 km.

In the sign convention followed here north and east are taken as positive and West and south are taken as negative.

Similarly, going along the positive X-axis is positive and going along the positive Y-axis is positive and going along the negative X-axis is negative and going along the negative Y-axis is negative.

A vector is typically represented by an arrow whose direction is the same as that of the quantity and whose length is proportional to the quantity’s magnitude. 

In the above example, 2 km is represented by an arrow of 1 cm taking the scale 1 km = 1 cm.

Initially, you are going towards East hence your displacement is represented as $ \vec{d} $ = 2 km
by an arrow like above. Directions are marked at the top of the page.

&rarr;

Here, the length of the arrow is 1 cm and the arrow head is pointing towards East represents the actual length 2 km.

&larr;

In the return journey you are travelling 2 km towards West from the shopping mall. Therefore, the arrow should point the West and the length is 1 cm as per the scale.

Here displacement is a vector and distance is a scalar.

A scalar has only magnitude and no direction.

Other examples for vectors are velocity, acceleration, force, momentum etc.

Speed, mass, temperature, density are examples for scalars.

## Rerpresentation of Vectors

Standard form of representation of vector is 

$\vec{A}=x \hat{i}+y \hat{j}+z\hat{k}$

Wherein, $x$ , $y$ and $z$ are the real numbers while $i$ , $j$ and $k$ are unit vectors along X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis respectively.

The Magnitude of a vector can be calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

$| \vec{A} |=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$

The following properties of vectors help in better understanding of vectors and are useful in performing numerous arithmetic operations involving vectors :-

## Vector Addition

Before we can learn about the properties of vector addition in maths, we must first understand the requirements that must be met while adding vectors.
The following are the requirements:

1. Only vectors of the same type can be combined together. Acceleration, for example, should be added with only acceleration and not displacement.

2. We can’t add vectors with any scalars. i.e, we cannot add 2 with vector $\vec{a}$

3. Vector Addition is **commutative**, meaning the order of vectors does not affect the result of the addition.  
$ \vec{a} + \vec{b} = \vec{b} + \vec{a}$

4. Vector Addition is **associative**: The mutual grouping of vectors has no effect on the result when adding three or more vectors together.  
$(\vec{a} + \vec{b}) + \vec{c} = \vec{a} + (\vec{b} + \vec{c})$

5. Vector addition is **distributive**: It indicates that the sum of scalar times the sum of two vectors equals the sum of the scalar times of the two vectors separately.  
$m(\vec{a} + \vec{c}) = m\vec{a} + m\vec{c}$

6. Existance of an Identity: For any vector  
$\vec{a}, \vec{a} + \vec{0} = \vec{a}$  
Here, $\vec{0}$ is the additive identity.

7. Existance of an inverse: An additive inverse exists for every vector.

Vectors can be added in two methods: -
1. Head to tail method or Geometric method
2. Using the trigonometric methods.

The process of addition of vectors takes into account of both magnitude and direction of the vectors.

### Addition of Collinear Vectors

The simplest situation occurs when the vectors point along the same direction. i.e., when they are collinear as shown in figure.

Here, a car first moves along a straight line, with a displacement vector $\vec{A}$ of 275 m, due east. Then the car moves again in the same direction, with a displacement vector $\vec{B}$ of 125 m, due east. These two vectors add to give the total displacement vector $\vec{R}$ which would apply if the car had moved from start to finish in one step. The symbol $\vec{R}$ is used because the total vector is often called the resultant vector. With the tail of the second arrow located at the head of the first arrow, the two lengths simply add to give the length of the total displacement. 

This kind of vector addition is identical to the familiar addition of two scalar numbers (2 + 3 = 5) and can be carried out here only because the vectors point along the same direction. In such cases we add the individual magnitudes to get the magnitude of the total, knowing in advance what the direction must be. Formally, the addition is written as follows:

$\vec{R} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}$

275 m, due east + 125 m, due east = 400 m, due east

### Addition of Perpendicular Vectors

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OjzF8EhKXETt2XW_Vm11pA7OEfzQdo8nGLR5slMHa6PbV7ZPtf8gRYqgU5RxVUWr_ENSNWx8A8VdV8mAGt0mZQ930TEobhmc-f9llii8JeoSG3MuxOdTzV1QGcSq51r7DXpTpB3sMcdaO5gBONCMNRJGxEgCXkzLIBuU44e13I-osB2p-31l78C2IqvRWYEVur6YXQbPAw)

This figure applies to a car that first travels with a displacement vector $\vec{A}$ of 275 m, due east, and then with a displacement vector $\vec{B}$ of 125 m, due north. The two vectors add to give a resultant displacement vector $\vec{R}$. Once again, the vectors to be added are arranged in a tail-to-head fashion, and the resultant vector points from the tail of the first to the head of the last vector added. The resultant displacement is given by the vector equation.

$\vec{R}=\vec{A}+\vec{B}$

The addition in this equation cannot be carried out by writing $\vec{R}$ = 275 m + 125 m, because the vectors have different directions. Instead, we take advantage of the fact that the triangle in the figure is a right triangle and use the Pythagorean theorem.

According to this theorem, the magnitude of $\vec{R}$ is

$\vec{R} = \sqrt{(275 m)^2 + (125 m)^2} = 302m$

The angle $\theta$ in Figure 1.10 gives the direction of the resultant vector. Since the lengths of all three sides of the right triangle are now known, $\sin$ $\theta$, $\cos$ $\theta$, or $\tan$ $\theta$ can be used to determine $\theta$. Noting that $\tan$ $\theta$ = $\vec{B}$/A and using the inverse trigonometric function, we find that:

$\theta = tan^-1 (\frac{B}{A}) = tan^-1 (\frac{125m}{275m}) = 24.4°$

Thus, the resultant displacement of the car has a magnitude of 302 m and points north of east at an angle of 24.4°. This displacement would bring the car from the start to the finish in the figure ina single straight-line step.

When two vectors to be added are not perpendicular, the tail-to-head arrangement does not lead to a right triangle, and the Pythagorean theorem cannot be used. Figure 1.0la illustrates such a case for a car that moves with a displacement $\vec{A}$ of 275 m, due east, and then with a displacement $\vec{B}$ of 125 m, in a direction 55.0° north of west. As usual, the resultant displacement vector $\vec{R}$ is directed from the tail of the first to the head of the last vector added. The vector addition is still given according to

$\vec{R}$=$\vec{A}$+$\vec{B}$

However, the magnitude of $\vec{R}$ is not $\vec{R}$ = $\vec{A}$ + $\vec{B}$, because the vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ do not have the same direction, and neither is it $\vec{R}$ = $\sqrt{(\vec{A})^2 + (\vec{B})^2}$, because the vectors are not perpendicular, so the Pythagorean theorem does not apply. Some other means must be used to find the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector.

One approach uses a graphical technique. In this method, a diagram is constructed in which the arrows are drawn tail to head. The lengths of the vector arrows are drawn to scale, and the angles are drawn accurately (with a protractor, perhaps). Then the length of the arrow representing the resultant vector is measured with a ruler. This length is converted to the magnitude of the resultant vector by using the scale factor with which the drawing is constructed. In Figure 1.01), for example, a scale of one centimeter of arrow length for each 10.0 m of displacement is used, and it can be seen that the length of the arrow representing $\vec{R}$ is 22.8 cm. Since each centimeter corresponds to 10.0 m of displacement, the magnitude of $\vec{R}$ is 228 m. The angle $\theta$,which gives the direction of R. can be measured with a protractor to be $\theta$ = 26.7° north of east.
