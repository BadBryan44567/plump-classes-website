## Force

In our daily life we pull and push objects from one place to another place. This *pull and push of an object by another object is called force.*
There are a variety of forces in nature.

We can broadly classify them into two forces: **Contact Forces** and **Non-contact Forces** :-

| Contact Forces | Non-Contact Forces  |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Applied Force  | Gravitational Force |
| Normal Force   | Electric Force      |
| Friction       | Magnetic Force      |
| Tension        | Nuclear Force       |

Before discussing these forces, let us see how to represent a force. At any instant of time *n* number of forces act on an object simultaneously. Since force is a vector, we have to follow the vector representation to draw the forces acting on an object. These diagrams depicting all the forces acting on an object are called **Free body diagrams (FBD) or force diagrams.**

Here are some of the examples for free body diagrams.
In the following FBD, we are representing all the forces acting on an object at the given instant. 

1. Forces Acting on an object

## Calculating the Resultant / Net Force Acting on an Object

Here we have to follow vector addition, subtraction, multiplication as the force is a vector.
Here an object is pulled by two different forces on two different directions.

Here the object of mass 18.36 kg is pulled by a 500N force at 300 with the horizontal.
On resolving the forces, we get the below picture.

Fx is the net force along the X-direction and Fy is the net force acting along the y-direction.
Let us see how to resolve the forces on a ramp.

A 45kg box is pulled by a 500N force along the ramp. The coefficient of friction is 0.5.

**Applied force (Fapp)** -  It is our common experience to pull a chair, push a chair. The pulling and pushing a chair by a person is the applied force. Here one object applies the force on another object.We all know that the fruits of a tree fall on the ground and any object thrown up falls down on the ground.  It is because of 

**Gravitational force (Fg)** -  Gravity is the pull of earth. Earth has the inherent ability to attract all the objects to its centre. It acts vertically downwards. It varies from place to place. Our weight is the pull of Earth. On Earth we take g value as 9.8N/kg.

Caution – don’t get confused between weight and mass.

**Weight** is a force. It is measured in newton in SI. In mathematical terms w=mg where w is weight, m is the mass and g is gravity. Weight is a vector quantity. As g varies from place to place, weight w also varies from place to place. Weight of an object is measured using Spring balance or Newton meter.

Whereas **mass** is the matter present in an object. It is scalar quantity. Mass is measured in Kg in SI. It remains same at all the places. Mass of an object is measured using simple balance or beam balance.

Here you may be wondering - Why do we measure our weight in Kg when the S.I Unit is Newton?

The reason is that g is approximately the same on Earth, we consider ‘g’ as constant and multiplying mass with g gives weight. we ignore that multiplication with a constant and use mass as weight in our day-to-day life. But in Physics, we distinguish them and use them appropriately.

Say, a person having mass 60 kg weighs 588N on earth.  The same person if he goes to moon, his mass will remain 60kg while his weight becomes 98N as g on moon is 1/6th of g of earth.

**Normal force** -  As the earth pulls all the objects towards its centre, a reaction force is required to keep the object intact on the earth. This reaction force applied by the surface on an object is called the normal force. This force always acts perpendicular to the surface.

For example, if a book is lying on a table means, the table is exerting normal force on the book. The normal force is perpendicular to the table. Similarly, if a person leans to a wall, then the wall exerts normal force on the person. In this case the normal force is in the horizontal direction. The magnitude of the normal force can be calculated using Newton's 3rd law.

Let us learn more about normal force with some numerical examples.

## Numericals On Normal Force	

If a 20kg box is lying on a table, then the weight is w=mg Hence w=20×9.8=196N. Normal force is the reaction force, therefore normal force exerted by the table on the box is also 196N. This can be represented by a FBD as follows.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZHPGPcKYKc1CBZmjSCX-NTsjm89dtYAu3PvZBRLkL83UDZK8Rd4iSmHz93SDlJGWulhiTXZ4CkYylAFNpv51WPFvhqK-lzSEQT0zVcbichyZPjVBfaKTWu24d5r69VB1tIzZspOpky3g-7Ihzc8INhiISwTfry_rSXgMfvJEIsZ6EXR19s8CM3X6VhX4sMCAdK5jEBVnRw)

If we place another box of mass 10kg on this box(20kg), then the normal force exerted by the 20kg box on the 10kg box is FN1=98N and the normal force exerted by the table on the 20kg box is FN2=294N. Since total weight on the table is 30kg×9.8N/kg=294N, reaction force is also 294N. This is depicted in the FBD below.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QVBM6nQfPTX4Yv4jA5wJDicuaHrDwQGHoXyrBKD4Ca9RYupHZ6rKJheqXKf-kEGiMC9-ZP3ZeIXQ0A5GElJ7fZWKcE4UhG-h0ZzsvQeeJFoLSqxXJYIH41Z9fO6ypI2-i6Stw5fKDi0Oh03JW2MAvdK1IoEENwwLSW46eDXgKYVVNy4ST9VbRkm4542OQKM2aOGmxdmiPA)

Let us see another example for the normal force to be horizontal.

You can hold a box against a rough wall and prevent it from slipping down by pressing it horizontally. The forces acting on the box can be depicted by FBD as follows.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Xt_JrKX47l3LgU6MgOu34FGXg7dmBxFAbqwNdeaYPKOf7trCU6Cz_8OzEy0Qufkzdz3keAcls3N6dHXrvUgg_gltECH4XAWosmiZjzIvqxwmU_rUpwikBtwCkBSEWJHxBHAZNpNTqke5rhXRVtzDLfR7LwTo1vdoPvT9FOz77BuAmYTSKEAY7OAxPPjbQD6zNSxsWWKd_w)

Here the applied force is horizontal, the wall exerts a reaction force on the box in the horizontal direction.

Normal force changes when an object accelerates. Let us see how it will be.

Suppose a man keeps a 70kg box on a weighing machine which is lying on the floor of an elevator. 
When the elevator is at rest the normal force = weight of the box.

Since, $\sum F_y = F_N - F_g = ma$
       $ a = 0, \to F_N = F_g $

Thus, normal force = 70×9.8=686N

If the elevator begins to move upwards with an acceleration of $1.2 m/s^2$

then according to Newton’s 2nd law, 
$\sum F_y = F_N - F_g = ma$
$F_g = mg$
$F_N  =  mg + ma$
$F_N  = 70(9.8 + 1.2) = 770 N $

Afterwards, if the elevator begins to move downwards with an acceleration of $1.2 m/s^2$ then, 

$\sum F_y = F_N - F_g = - ma$
$F_N  =  mg - ma$
$F_N  = 70(9.8 - 1.2) = 602 N $

## Numericals on Contact Forces

**Contact force** : - When two objects are in contact with each other, contact force acts on these objects. These contact forces are action reaction forces as per Newton’s 3rd law.

Let us try to understand these contact forces by a numerical example.
3kg,4kg,5kg boxes are lined up in a row on a frictionless table. All the three are pushed forward by a 24N force applied to the 3kg box. 

1.  How much force is exerted by a 4kg box on 5kg box?
2. How much force is exerted by a 4kg box on 3kg box?

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/AfXErUl4YoJfQznf358ZmqJKZbTjmCvva1om7Y4SHomvSAguOlwZCHNjb6at_QjgEZy_bmT-0UhBtKYOZGRACOWH5Gnu701F0N6IraKcIuz9yByMeIhAlfWJVFl4HoQZrpgWjNVsN6qmnZw-06OoF1M20crKWvrzEvamsftfPyXXn9yPtKoKoW1aa_fOMC6WlkFs4PlBSA)

Total mass=12kg

1. $\sum F_{Ne}t = ma$
$24 N=12a$
$a=2 ms^2$
$F_{Net} - F_{contact} = ma$
$F_{contact} = F_{Net} - ma$
$F_{contact} = 24 - 5 × 2 = 14 N$

2. $F_{contact} = 24 - 3 × 2 = 18 N$

**Friction force (F<sub>fr</sub>)**: - Whenever two objects are in contact with each other friction force comes into picture. Friction force Ffr=µFN   µ is called the coefficient of friction. It depends on the surfaces that are in contact with each other. There are two types of friction. Static friction, which comes into effect when an object rests on another object. 

For E.g. A book lying on a table. Here static friction is acting between the two objects. F<sub>fr</sub>= µ<sub>SFN</sub>. µS is the coefficient of static friction. Whenever an object moves or rolls on another object, kinetic friction comes into picture. F<sub>fr</sub>= µ<sub>KFN</sub> and µ<sub>K</sub> is the coefficient of kinetic friction. µ<sub>S </sub> is always greater than the µ<sub>K</sub>.
We pull the object by the cables, we hang the chandeliers with ropes, we travel on ropeways. In all these cases the force acting through the cable, rope and string is the 

**Tension force (F<sub>T</sub>)** -  When an object is pulled by another object through a cable or rope or string, tension force transmits through the cable.
