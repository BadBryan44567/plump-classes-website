## Newton's 3rd law
Before studying the Newton's 3rd law, let us see whaaat are these action and reaction forces. We will analyse few situations to understand the action reaction forces.

**Example1**:- A boy and girl standig on ice (ice offers zero friction) facting each other, holding their hands together and push each other. take the mass of the boy is greater than the mass of the girl. As they push each other, they move in opposite to each other. the question is how far they move from each other. Here they both exert equal amount of force on each other and as the mass of the boy is greaater, he moves less distance than the girl.

**Numerial example:-**

Two skarers, a man and a woman, are standing on ice. Neglect the friction between the skate and the ice. The mass of the man is 80 kg, and the mass of the woman is 50 kg. The woman pushes the man with a force of 45 N due east. Determine the acceleration (magnitude and direction) of (a) man (b) woman

$$ a_m = \frac{45N}{80kg}=0.56\frac{m}{s^2} East $$
$$ a_w = \frac{45N}{50kg} = 0.9 \frac{m}{s^2} West $$

**Example2**:- When we walk on the ground, the sole applies the force on the ground and pushes backwards, and the ground applies the same amount of force on the sole of the shoe and pushes forward. Here the pushing force is the frictional force between the ground and the sole of the shoe. These are action-reaction forces acting on two different bodies. These forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let us understand this with a numerial example

A bulldozer with mass 100 kg is pushing a block that has a mass of 500 kg. The coefficient of friction between the bulldozer and the ground is 0.5, and the coefficient of friction between the block and the ground is 0.4. Find the maximum acceleratiion of the block and the force of dozer on the block.

Let
The frictional force between the ground and the dozer tracks = F_gb [this pushes dozer forward ]
The frictional force between the dozer and the ground = F_bg [this force pushes the ground backwards. since mass of the ground is huge, no noticable movement.]

According to the Newton's 3rd law  $F_bg = F_gb$

$$\Sigma F_Net = F_gb - F_fr from block = ma$$
$$F_fr = \mu F_N = 0.5\times1000\times9.8 = 4900 N $$
$$ F_{bg} = 4900 N $$
Friction between the block and ground $= 0.4\times500\times9.8 = 1960 N$
$$4900 - 1960 = 1500\times(a)$$
$$a = 1.96\frac{m}{s^2}$$
Force of the dozer on the block = $500\times1.96 = 980N$
We can explain the rocket propulsion with the help of Newton's 3rd law.
In rocket propulsion, rocket engine pushes the hot gases downwards, in turn the gases push the rocket in the upward direction. When this upward thrust or push exceeds the weight of the rocket, it accelerates upwards because of the unbalanced forces. (Note that earth is not pushing the rocket. It's only the hot gases from the rocket which are the reaction forces pushing the rocket upwards.)

**One more example** : if we hit a nail with a hammer, the force of the hammer on the nail is equal and opposite to the force of the nail on the hammer.

*The Newton's 3rd law states that whenever an object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an oppositely directed force of equal magnitude on the first object.
$$F_{12}= - F_{21}$$
**another example**
Henry pushes a grocery cart of mass 12.0 kg with 7.0 kg groceries in it. Mass of the Henry is 65.0 kg. Calculate the acceleration produced when Henry exerts a backward force of 150N on the floor. [all the forces opposing the motion, such as friction onthe cart's wheel and air resisstance, total 24.0N] calculate the force exerted by henry on the cart. 
Let us consider Henry and grocery cart as system 1 and the groccery cart as sysstem 2
$$\Sigma F_{net}=F_{floor} - F_{fr}=ma$$
$$a=\frac{150-24}{965+12+7}=\frac{126}{84}=1.5\frac{m}{s^2}$$

**To answer the 2nd question consider the system 2**
 $$F_{net}=F_{push} - F_{fr}=ma$$
 $$F_{push}=(ma)+F_[fr]$$
 $$F_{push}=(19kg\times1.5m/s^2)+24.0N=53.0N$$
 Now we will apply Newton's 2nd and 3rd laws to interacting objects.
 The below figure shows a 4.0 kg object being pushed by 30.0 N force. In front of this block is 8.0 kg block. The two blocks move together. What is the force exerted by 4 kg block on 8 kg block [ignore frictional forces]
 According to Newton's 2nd law,
 $$\Sigma F=ma$$
 $$30.0N=(4+8)kg\times(a)$$
 $$a=\frac{30.0}{12}=2.5\frac{m}{s^2} $$
 $$a=(8.0) \times (2.5) = 20.0N$$
 This can be done in other way also
 $$\Sigma F_(net)=F_(app)-F_(con)=ma$$
 $$F_(con)=30.0 - 4\times 2.5 = 20.0N$$
 If the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.050, what will be the contact force?
 $$F_(net)=F_(applied)-F_(fr)$$
 $$F_(fr)=\mu F_N$$
 $$\Sigma F_y=F_N - F_g =0$$
 $$F_N = F_g$$
$$ F_(fr)=0.050\times12\times9.8 = 5.88N$$
$$F_(net)=30.0-5.88 = 24.12$$
$$a=\frac{24.12}{12} = 2.01\frac{m}{s^2}$$
$$F_(contact)-F_(fr)=ma$$
$$F_(contact)=0.050 \times8 \times9.8 + 8 \times2.01=20.0N$$

3kg,4kg,5kg boxes are lined up in a row on a frictionless table. All the three are pushed forward by a 24N force applied to the 3kg box.
(a) How much force is exerted by a 4kg box on 5 kg box ?
(b) how much force is exerted by a 4 kg box on 3 kg box?
total mass = 12kg
$$\Sigma F_{net}=ma$$
$$24N=12a$$
$$a=2\frac{m}{s^2}$$
$$F_{net}-F_{contact}=ma$$
$$F_{contact}=F_{net}-ma$$
$$F_{contact}=24-5\times{2}=14N$$
Force exerted by the 4.0 kg block
$$F_{contact}=24-3\times{2}=18N$$

A man holding two boxed with massess 6kg and 10kg [one on top of other] enters into an elevator and keeps them on a weighing scale sitting on the floor. While accelerating upward from rest, the man observes that the scale reads a value of 200N. Find the acceleration of the elevator and the force acting between the boxes.

$$F_N-F_g=ma$$
$$200-(16 \times 9.8)=16.0(a) $$
$$\frac{43.2}{16.0}=a$$
$$a=2.7\frac{m}{s^2}$$
$$F_{contact}-F_g=ma$$
$$F_{contact}=(6.0 \times 9.8) + (6.0 \times 2.7)$$
$$F_{contact} = 75.0N$$
