## What is Power ?

Power is the rate of doing work or raate of transfer of energy.
$$Power P= \frac{work}{time} = \frac{j}{s}=watt$$
$$power P = \frac{Energy}{time} = \frac{j}{s} = watt $$
$$1joule = 1watt\times 1second$$
As watt is a smaller unit, we use kilowatt.
$$1kilo - watt = 1000watt$$
Generally, power is measured in kilowatt-hour or horse power.
$$1kwh = 1000watt\times3600sec = 3.6\times10^6j$$
$$1h.p = 746w$$
Let us see one more way to express power.
$$Power = \frac{\vec{F} . \vec{d} }{t} = \vec{F} . \vec{v}$$
$$\frac{d}{t} = \nu A$$
Where d is the displacement and t is time and v is velocity.
Now let us see the Power in electric energy.

## Power in Electric Energy

What is electric energy? Or electrostatic potential energy?
It is also a conservative energy. That means the force *will NOT* depend on the actual path followed by the object.
$$U_{electric} = -W = |\vec{F}| . |\vec{d} |\cos \cos 180Â°$$

Where F is the electric force and d is the distance.

Meaning of negative sign:- An electric field possess a radial force which is always directed outwards while the charge displaces inward. Hence, angle between the force and displacement is $ 180^0 $

This electric force is a force at a distance. Electric force is a non-contact force like gravitational force.These kinds of forces act other objects without touching them(contacting them).

### Electric Field

To understand the concept,we have to look into the electric field defined by Faraday.

According to Michael Faraday, an electric field extends outward from every charage and permeates all of space(fig.1). If a second charge (call it $Q_2 $) is plced near the first charge, it feels a force exerted by the electric field thaat is there (say, at point P in fig.1). The electric field at point P is considered to interact directly with charge $ Q_2 $ to produce the force on $ Q_2 $

Now we will measure the elctric field surrounding a charge or a group of charges by measuring the force on a small positive test charge which is at resst.(Test charge means a charge so small that the force it exerts does not significatly affect the charges that create the field.) In fig 2 we placed a tiny positive test charge q in the vicinity of a single positive charge Q at different points A,B,C. The force exerted at C< B< A. Since the distance of C>B>A. The electric field, at any point divided by the magnitude of the test charge q.
3 field at point P is considered to interact directly with charge $ Q_2 $ to produce the force on $ Q_2 $

$$\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}q\frac{newton}{coulomb}$$
$$\vec{F} = q\vec{E}$$


The electric field at any point in space can be measured, based on the definition. For simple situations with one or several point charges, we can calculate E. For example, the electric field at a disstance r from a single point charge Q would have magnitude
$$E = \frac{F}{q}=\frac{kQq}{r^2}{q}=\frac{kQ}{r^2}$$
K=constant, Q and q are changes and r is the distance between the charges. In terms of $\epsilon_0$, 
$$ k=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$$ Thus, E is independent of test charge q.
If q is positive, both F and E are in the same direction, and if q is negative F and E are in opposite direction.

Now let us try to understand the electric potential energy.

### Electric Potential Energy

Consider the electric field between two equally but oppositely charged parallel plated; we assume their separation is small compared to their width and height, so the field will be uniform kver most of the region. Now consider a tiny positive point charge q placed at the point 'a' very near the positive pllate as shown. This charge q is so small that it has no effect on E. If this charge q at point 'a' is released, the electric force will do work on the charge and accelerate it toward the negative plate. The work W done by the electric field E to move the charge a distance d is
$$w = Fd = qEd$$
