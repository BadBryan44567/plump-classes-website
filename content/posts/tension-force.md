The above system is called Atwood machine.
To find the acceleration and tension in the cable, we have to write the force equations for the masses $ m_1$, $m_2$

$$F_(g1)= m_1 g  and $$
$$F_(g_1)= m_2 g$$
$$F_{g_2}-F_T=m_2 a$$
$$F_T=F_{g_2}-m_2 a$$
$$F_T=m_2 g - m_2 a$$
for mass 
$$m_1$$
$$F_T - F_{g1} = m_1 a$$
$$m_2g-m_2a-m_1g = m_1a$$
$$(m_2-m_1)g = (m_1+m_2)a$$
$$a=\frac{(m_2-m_1)g}{m_1+m_2}$$
$$F_T=m_2g-m_2a$$
$$F_T=m_2g-m_2\frac{(m_2-m_1)g}{m_1+m_2}$$
$$F_T=\frac{2m_1m_2g}{m_1+m_2}$$
We need not do the numerical problem for this as is jusst plugging in the numbers to get the answer.

But how to remember the formula?

To find the acceleration, we are using the Newton's 2^nd law.
$$\sum{F_(net)}=ma$$
Here m is the total mass and net force is the difference in weights of the masses. $F_g$ is nothing but weight.

Tension is the net force acting on any of the masses. Since tension in the sstring is same, we can calculaatae it easily from the force diagram.


Next problem-

Two boxes are connected by a cord running over a pulley. The coefficient of kinetic frictiion between box A and the table is $ \mu_k $ We ignore the mass of the cord and pulley and any friction in the pulley, which means we can asume that a force applied to one end of the cord will have the same magnitude at the other end. We wish to find the acceleration, a of the system, which will have the same magnitude for both assuming the cord doesn't strect. As box B moves down, box A moves to the right.

Let us write the force equation for $ m_2 $
$$\sum{F_y}=F_T-F_g=-m_2a$$
negaative sign indicates mass $ m_2 $ is going down. (we consider downwaaard directiion as negative)

Force equation for $ m_1 $
